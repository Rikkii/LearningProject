# LearningProject

Hi! I am Vera. This is my learning project where I've built a backend service for online school using Spring Boot framework.

Features:

1) You can add student and course into H2 tables
2) You can communicate with the system using URLs made in RESTful style
3) You can set authorization rules in order to prevent unwanted changes

If you have any thoughts how to improve my code I would be happy to get them!
